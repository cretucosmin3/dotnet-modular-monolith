# dotnet-modular-monolith
A scalable monolith backend model

### The Problem:
Microservices are too complex for 90% of projects, but standard Monoliths become "Spaghetti Code" that can't be scaled independently.

### The Solution:
This template. A modular monolith that can compile all the modules together or partially to deploy only the features you need for specific server roles.
